### Project: FinBook

FinBook is a desktop app for Financial Assistant (FA) to manage their client details and ensure that your data is
secured. With FinBook, you can set a unique password, manage and view client's details, meetings and portfolio as well
as many other features to make your daily workflow much more efficient!

### Overview

FinBook is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI), which means most of our commands are done by typing.

        * Portfolio details include: Risk level, current plans purchased by client, additional notes
        * Justification: Since Financial Advisor spents majority of time doing administrative work, this feature would
          greatly reduce the time spent taking notes and referring to notes from other platforms (eg. Notes app) as this
          feature provides the ability to organise these clients neatly in one application.
