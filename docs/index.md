**FinBook is a desktop app for Financial Assistant (FA) to manage their client details and ensure that your data is
secured**. With FinBook, you can set a unique password, manage and view client's details, meetings and portfolio as well as many
other features to make your daily workflow **much more efficient!**

FinBook is optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)**, which means most of our commands are done by typing.
If you can type fast, managing your clients will be a breeze with FinBook. Can't type fast? Don't worry! Our Graphical
User Interface (GUI) will help you slowly adjust to using our CLI.
* If you are interested in using FinBook, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing FinBook, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
